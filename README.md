#Objectect
Objetecht was created for the sole purpose of trying to help identify. It can identify anything from a teddy bear to fire. This, however, does not come at the cost of slow performance, rather it is a light-weight app. Objetecht also has a high confidence in its identifications. This app is an all-purpose identifier, with a light software and an easy interface, to help users identify easily with high accuracy. There are many modes of input for user comfort, with each suited for specific identification. In case the interface is hard to understand, there is an user manual attached. For the visually impaired, the results could be read by the inbuilt reader.
